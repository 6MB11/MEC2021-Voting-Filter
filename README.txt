# MEC2021-Voting-Filter
This is a java program that takes raw voting data and displays election results after processing the data to eliminate any invalid votes.


To run the final program, 
1. Download the project as a .zip file
2. Open the /dist folder
3. Run the MECProgramming.jar application

If the steps above do not work, the java file in the /src directory can also be run using the "java UserInterface.java" command in the terminal
The project can also be loaded into NetBeans and the UserInterface.java file can also be run from there 


The program was written entirely in Java using the Netbeans IDE.
